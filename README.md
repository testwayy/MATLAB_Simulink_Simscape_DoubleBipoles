# MATLAB, Simulink, and Simscape (Double Bipoles)

## üìö Introduction

My name is **Stefano Caramagno**, and I'm pleased to present this repository containing exercises on **double bipoles** analyzed in **MATLAB**, **Simulink**, and **Simscape**. <br>
These exercises were completed as part of **Basic Electrical Engineering (Electrotechnics)** course during my **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering** at the **University of Catania**.

## ‚ú® Features

- **MATLAB Scripting**: Runs scripts to set parameters, compute responses, and generate circuit analysis.
- **Simulink Circuit Modeling**: Simulates electrical circuits using a block diagram approach.
- **Simscape Physical Components**: Uses realistic electrical elements for accurate simulations.
- **Double Bipole Analysis**: Examines voltage, current, and power behavior in circuits with bipoles.
- **Configurable Circuit Parameters**: Allows modifying resistance, capacitance, and inductance values.
- **Graphical Visualization**: Provides waveform plots and circuit response graphs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: MATLAB for processing simulation data and performing calculations.
- **Development Environment**: MATLAB R2022b or later for data analysis and circuit simulation.
- **Toolbox Dependencies**:
   - **Symbolic Math Toolbox** for symbolic calculations.
   - **Simulink** for block-based system modeling and simulation.
   - **Simscape** for physical system simulation.
- **Version Control**: Git for tracking changes and managing project versions.  
- **Repository Hosting**: GitHub for storing, sharing, and maintaining the project repository.  

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system before proceeding:

- **MATLAB**: Version R2022b or later, required to compute and simulate MATLAB projects.
- **Required Toolboxes**: Install the following toolboxes using the Add-On Explorer:  
  - **Symbolic Math Toolbox**: Required for symbolic calculations.
  - **Simulink**: Required for block-based system modeling and simulation.
  - **Simscape**: Required for physical system simulation.
- **Git**: Used to clone the repository.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
    To download the repository and navigate to its directory:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/stefanocaramagno/MATLAB_Simulink_Simscape_DoubleBipoles.git
    ```

2. **Open MATLAB and Choose a Directory**  

    To navigate to one of the directories containing a simulation (e.g., Exercises 01):

    ```matlab
    cd 'MATLAB_Simulink_Simscape_DoubleBipoles/Exercise 01'
    ```

### Running the Simulation

1. **Open the Simulink Model**  

    To open the Simulink model inside the selected directory:

    ```matlab
    open('exercise_01_simscape.slx')
    ```

2. **Run the MATLAB Script**

    To execute the MATLAB script inside the selected directory:

    ```matlab
    run('exercise_01_script.m')
    ```
